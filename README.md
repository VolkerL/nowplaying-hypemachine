# NowPlaying - HypeMachine

NowPlaying - HypeMachine is a Chrome browser extension that can tell [Last.fm](http://last.fm) what you are currently listening to on [HypeMachine](http://hypem.com).

HypeMachine already scrobbles your tracks to your Last.fm profile after they have been playing for a while,
but that is only half of the actual scrobbling process.
This Chrome extension will do the other half.
It notifies Last.fm about which track is currently playing.

Using NowPlaying - Hypemachine and HypeMachine's native scrobbling feature together will result in a proper scrobbling process.
This means that you can now use an application like [NowPlaying](http://github.com/volkerl/releases)
when listening to your tracks on HypeMachine.
