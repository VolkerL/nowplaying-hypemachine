# NowPlaying - HypeMachine

NowPlaying - HypeMachine allows you to notify Last.fm of the track you are currently playing on HypeMachine.

HypeMachine already allows you to scrobble your tracks to Last.fm,
but they are only scrobbled after they have been playing for a while.
Last.fm also allows applications to tell what track is currently playing.
This allows other applications, like the NowPlaying application (http://github.com/volkerl/nowplaying/releases),
to query your current playing track.
