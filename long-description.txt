NowPlaying - HypeMachine is a Chrome browser extension that can tell Last.fm what you are currently listening to on HypeMachine.

HypeMachine already scrobbles your tracks to your Last.fm profile after they have been playing for a while, but that is only half of the actual scrobbling process. This Chrome extension will do the other half. It notifies Last.fm about which track is currently playing.

Using NowPlaying - Hypemachine and HypeMachine's native scrobbling feature together will result in a proper scrobbling process.
This means that your current playing song will be returned by the Last.fm user.getRecenTracks api call.
